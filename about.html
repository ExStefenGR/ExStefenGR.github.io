            <h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>
            <p>As a QA Specialist with a strong foundation in games programming (C/C++, C#, Unity, and Unreal Engine 5), I specialize in navigating the complexities of new hardware launches. My work in both Functional (FQA) and Compliance (CQA) involves partnering directly with development teams to identify critical stability issues, find performance bottlenecks, and ensure titles meet rigorous platform-holder standards.</p>
            
            <p>At my core, I am a creator. This professional focus on quality is deeply informed by my personal passion for game development, a craft I actively pursue in my free time. Beyond finding bugs, I am dedicated to elevating team performance by authoring clear technical documentation and developing robust training materials, always aiming for a seamless and memorable player experience.</p>
