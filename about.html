            <h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a dedicated Games Programmer with a strong foundation in C/C++, C#, and experience in Unity and Unreal Engine 5. I have proven experience in leading and contributing to diverse game projects, demonstrating expertise in both 2D and 3D game development, as well as in Game Testing and Quality Assurance.</p><br>
            <p>My professional journey includes roles as a Compliance QA Technician and FQA Technician at Universally Speaking, where I collaborated with production teams to identify and report application stability and functionality issues. I've also participated in beta testing for major titles like <em>Kingdom Hearts: Missing Link</em> and a confidential project with Electronic Arts, providing critical feedback on gameplay mechanics, level design, and overall user experience.</p><br>
            <p>Passionate about game development, I continually seek opportunities to apply my skills and contribute to innovative projects. My ability to manage and deliver multiple projects on schedule, coupled with effective communication and technical writing skills, enables me to collaborate successfully with multidisciplinary teams.</p>
